## Why'd we make this?
Reeto and I have both loved basketball and were also into the sports game NBA2K, which focused a lot on player stats (in their personal probabilities of performing in the game and also post-game results). Naturally, there are plenty of tools to check player stats from real NBA players too, so we thought we'd make this Discord Bot to do just that and more as a fun side-project!
